# Contributing to LF Launcher

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **LF Launcher**, a
lightweight and modern Minecraft Bedrock launcher for Android developed
by **LastFom Studio**. To maintain stability, consistency, and quality
across the project, please follow the guidelines below.

## Overview

This document outlines how contributions should be made, the rules you
must follow, and how to interact respectfully within the LF Launcher
GitHub environment. All contributors must read this before submitting
any pull request.

## Soft Floor Guidelines

*Recommended --- not strictly required, but strongly encouraged.* -
Avoid renaming files unless you are fixing naming inconsistencies. -
Keep commits small, focused, and clearly labeled. - Follow the existing
UI structure, coding style, and naming conventions used throughout LF
Launcher. - Whenever possible, test your changes on a real Android
device to avoid unexpected behaviors.

## Hard Floor Rules

*Mandatory --- cannot be broken under any circumstances.* - You must
comply with the project's Code of Conduct. - Do not alter the root
folder structure of the repository. - Do not introduce UI or UX changes
that move the project away from the official LF Launcher design
direction. - Do not commit build files, generated files, temporary
files, or caches. - Do not merge unstable or experimental features into
main branches without approval. - Any change affecting core systems
requires careful review.
